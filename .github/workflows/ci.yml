# A human-readable name for our workflow
name: Run Backend Tests

# --- Trigger Conditions ---
# This workflow will run automatically on:
# 1. Pushes to the 'main' branch
# 2. Pull Requests that target the 'main' branch
# Update: now only runs for any file in the backend/ dir on the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
    paths:
      - 'backend/**'
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
    paths:
      - 'backend/**'

# --- Jobs ---
jobs:
  # We have a single job named 'build-and-test-backens'
  build-and-test-backend:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Set the working directory for all sebsequent steps in this job
    # Prevents us from adding the 'backend/' prefix to all steps
    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: ./backend

    steps:
    # Step 1: Get a copy of our repository's code
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # Step 2: Set up a specific version of Python
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: '3.12'

    # Step 3: Install our project's dependencies from requirements.txt
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

    # Step 4: Run our tests using pytest!
    # If any test fails, pytest will exit with a non-zero status code,
    # which will cause this step (and the entire job) to fail.
